# UPBGE Ports

This is a port started by Guilherme here (from Uniday Studio) to adapt BGUI library to upbge 0.2.5 & 0.3+

Currently, I (lordloki) am focused in to adapt this library for UPBGE 0.3+.

The purpose is to simplify several parts and reusing internal libraries (bfl, gpu, etc) and to remove specific OpenGL code replacing it by gpu library code.
